Don't worry Pepo, let me help you :)

We have a big hint in the title. The "Metadata". 

*The Metadata are some informations that describe or relate to a file, such as its name, size, type, date, author, location, and tags.*



So there are several ways to extract metadata from an image. But the easiest way is to use a website. I've used BrandFolder. All I have to do is paste the image into the site, and it returns all the metadata.

43 deg 17' 56.27" N, 5 deg 22' 49.38" E --> 43°17'56.3"N 5°22'49.4"E .

Paste the coordinates on google maps ...
**Pepo is located in marseilles**
