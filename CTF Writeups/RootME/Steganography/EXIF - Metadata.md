We have a big hint in the title. The "Metadata". 

*The Metadata are some informations that describe or relate to a file, such as its name, size, type, date, author, location, and tags.*

So, to extract Metadata from an image, there are multiple ways to do this. But the simpliest way is to use a website. I used BrandFolder. Simply paste the image into it, and it gives me back all Metadata.

43 deg 17' 56.27" N, 5 deg 22' 49.38" E --> 43°17'56.3"N 5°22'49.4"E .

Paste the coordinates on google maps ...
**Pepo is located in marseilles**
