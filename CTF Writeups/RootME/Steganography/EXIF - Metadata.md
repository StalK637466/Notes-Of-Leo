*Don't worry Pepo, let me help you :)*

We have a big hint in the title. The "Metadata". 

*The Metadata are some informations that describe or relate to a file, such as its name, size, type, date, author, location, and tags.*



So there are several ways to extract metadata from an image. But the easiest way is to use a website. I've used [BrandFolder.](https://brandfolder.com/workbench/extract-metadata) All I have to do is paste the image into the site, and it returns all the metadata.

43 deg 17' 56.27" N, 5 deg 22' 49.38" E --> [43°17'56.3"N 5°22'49.4"E](https://www.google.com/maps/place/53+Rue+Saint-Bazile,+13001+Marseille/@43.2989722,5.377814,17z/data=!4m12!1m5!3m4!2zNDPCsDE3JzU2LjMiTiA1wrAyMic0OS40IkU!8m2!3d43.2989722!4d5.3803889!3m5!1s0x12c9c097cf70cc4d:0x3da1340587ff952f!8m2!3d43.3003717!4d5.3815047!16s%2Fg%2F11c3q3x34_?entry=ttu) .

Paste the coordinates on google maps ...
