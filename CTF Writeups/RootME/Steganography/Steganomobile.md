## Description:
After extracting data from a cell phone found at the scene of a crime, investigators recovered this sequence of numbers... Could it be a phone number?

## Solution:

>### Sequence of numbers : **222-33-555-555-7-44-666-66-33**

The clues given all have one thing in common: the cell phone. As I typed "cell phone" on the Internet, I remembered that there were touchtone phones, and that you could write messages on them. What if it was a message?

I took an image of a touchtone phone and decoded the message.

The decoded message is **cellphone** and it's the *Multi-tap* code
