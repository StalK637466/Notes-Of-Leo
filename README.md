> ### What Is a CTF ? 🏁

Capture the Flag (CTF): gamified activity consisting in obtaining a sensitive piece of information, the flag. The flag is usually a string of alphanumeric characters. To obtain this string of characters, you need to meet a challenge linked to the understanding of a technical IT concept.

The CTFs bring together a set of problems whose resolution gives more or less points depending on the difficulty, the number of resolutions or a set of notation rules chosen. The main categories are Web, Forensics, Steganography, Crypto, Binary Analysis, Reverse Engeneering, Network, System Administration (sysadmin), etc.
